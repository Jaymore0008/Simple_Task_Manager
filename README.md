# Simple Task Manager (C++)

## Overview
The **Simple Task Manager** is a C++ command-line program that allows users to add, delete, update, and list tasks. Each task has an ID, name, and priority. The program also allows tasks to be sorted by their priority using the **Bubble Sort** algorithm. This project demonstrates **OOP concepts** and **basic sorting algorithms**.

## Features
- Add a task with an ID, name, and priority.
- Delete a task by ID.
- Update a task's priority.
- List all tasks.
- Sort tasks by priority (higher priority first).

## Concepts Used
- **OOP Concepts**: Classes, Encapsulation.
- **Data Structures**: Arrays (for storing tasks).
- **Sorting Algorithm**: Bubble Sort (for sorting tasks by priority).

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/Jaymore0008/Simple_Task_Manager.git`
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ task_manager.cpp -o task_manager
